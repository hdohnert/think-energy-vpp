  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <div class="faq">
    <h4>Will I still use Think Energy as my electricity provider?</h4>
    <p>Yes. When you sign up, you‚Äôll receive power from Think Energy as your official electricity provider. We‚Äôll supply your home with affordable electricity and handle billing, service, and support.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h4>How does Think Energy make money?</h4>
    <p>We use your battery to support the electricity grid when there's no outage. This allows us to recover the cost of the battery system and installation ‚Äî while still offering you a low, fixed electricity rate. It‚Äôs a win-win: reliable backup for you, and better grid performance for everyone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h4>How long does my battery last during a power outage?</h4>
    <p>The backup duration depends on four key factors:</p>
    <ul class="faq-list">
      <li><strong>Power usage:</strong> The more devices you run (like central A/C or electric dryers), the faster the battery drains. Limiting usage helps extend runtime.</li>
      <li><strong>Battery charge at the time of outage:</strong> Your battery is typically well-charged, but due to grid-balancing usage, it may vary. It will never drop below 20% before an outage.</li>
      <li><strong>System size:</strong> Homes have one battery (~20‚Äì25 kWh) or two (~50 kWh). More storage means more backup time.</li>
      <li><strong>Solar or generator add-ons:</strong> If installed, these can extend backup time by recharging the battery during the outage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here‚Äôs a rough idea of how long your system will last based on your usage:</p>
    <ul class="faq-duration">
      <li><strong>Low usage (750W):</strong> 20‚Äì30 hrs (1 battery), 40‚Äì60 hrs (2 batteries)</li>
      <li><strong>Average usage (1.5kW):</strong> 10‚Äì15 hrs (1 battery), 20‚Äì30 hrs (2 batteries)</li>
      <li><strong>High usage (8kW):</strong> 2‚Äì3 hrs (1 battery), 3‚Äì5 hrs (2 batteries)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You‚Äôll also be able to view your battery‚Äôs charge and estimated runtime from your Think Energy dashboard.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h4>What should I expect on the day of installation?</h4>
    <p>The installation process is simple and handled entirely by our team. Here‚Äôs what to expect:</p>
    <ul class="faq-list">
      <li><strong>Material drop-off:</strong> A pallet of equipment may be delivered before the crew arrives.</li>
      <li><strong>Arrival window:</strong> Our crew typically arrives between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary power shutoff:</strong> Expect 1‚Äì3 hours of planned disconnection as we reconfigure your wiring.</li>
      <li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> Any packaging or leftover materials will be picked up later that day or the next morning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After installation, connect your system to your Wi-Fi network using your Think Energy dashboard. It may take up to 48 hours for the system to fully sync.</p>
